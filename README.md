# SnakeLauncher86 (sl86) â€” a text-mode 86Box machine manager for macOS
This text-mode manager consists of a singular Python script.
Needless to say, you MUST have Python installed for this to function.

To use:
1. Download `main.py`
2. Create `app.txt` and `machines.txt` in the same directory
3. Specify where `86Box.app` (the 86Box app itself) is located in `app.txt`
4. Create a directory for machines to be stored and specify said location in `machines.txt`
5. Run the script by going to the manager script's location in the terminal and running `python3 main.py`

I am available in the 86Box Discord server (https://discord.gg/86box) if you have any questions.
