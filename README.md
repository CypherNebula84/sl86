# SnakeLauncher86 (sl86) â€” a text-mode 86Box machine manager
This Python script allows to manage your 86Box machines from the command line.

## Setup
1. Download the latest release
2. Locate your 86Box installation
3. Edit your `launcher.cfg` file to contain the path to your 86Box executable (i.e. `C:\Users\foo\86Box\86Box.exe`) and machines folder (i.e. `C:\Users\foo\86Box\machines`)
4. Run `python launcher.py` or `python3 launcher.py`

I am available in the 86Box Discord server (https://discord.86box.net) if you have any questions.
